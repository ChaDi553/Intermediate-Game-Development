Talk about your landscape game - what types of games come to mind? What can you do with what you have? Talk about your brainstorming process.

My landscape game reminds me mostly of puzzle or exploratory games that have to do with deciphering hidden meaning to reveal some sort of truth.
A game I had in mind when creating this game was unpacking. It is a fairly new game, and although I haven't played it, the vibe is very similar to what 
I'm trying to achive in this game. The goal of the game is to let the player explore the game through visual and (ideally) auditory cues. This game would 
most likely be for a player who likes mystery games or puzzle games.With what I have so far I can totally make a landscape game that is centered around 
exploration through text. For some reason I'm thinking audio cues will be harder to  execute in a way that isn't cheesy. Having it be analog text makes it 
so the character is acutally reading about an artifact like in a meusuem rather hearing a voice talk to them about it 
like they are actually present in the scene. I really wanted to pick a game that was heavy on visuals so I chose to 
move forward with a game whos main function is exploration.
