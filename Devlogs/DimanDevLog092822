Devlog prompt: Discuss your process of working on your Rube Goldberg machine!

Working on the Rube Goldberg Machine was funner than I thought it would be. I really didn't do much 
coding which is maybe why I enjoyed it so much.I liked playing around with the different colliders. 
I found a different way to make the camera follow the ball without coding or attaching the player 
to the camera  ,but it still seems like there are some problems with the smoothness of it and 
I'm not sure how I couldve changed it. My favorite part about this project was making the art assets.
I really wanted to have fun because I really don't like coding and drawing the sprites made this 
more bearable. This rube goldberg machine actomatically reminded me of 3D mobile games that
are really popular (and annoying,but yet so addictive) right now and rely heavily on physics...
and at times have the most ridicolus art assets. I wanted to draw things that had nothing to do with 
each other. I was fun to draw without purpose.
