			My midterm project was a long process. I'm really not good at coding, but I
	  knew going into this that I wanted to make someting that was more focused on 
	  environment and narrative rather than mechanics. I more attracted wansto "sappy" 
	  games that are more sentimental and are more down to earth. I decided to start 
	  with the art because I thought that it would give me a clearer vision as to what 
	  I wanted to do with the game in terms of the narrative flow. I initially wanted 
	  to make a game where the player could just sit and click on each object and a 
	  little description would pop up. I later started to think that it was too simple. 
	  After developing ideas while drawing the start screen, game screen and room
	  object assets I decided that it would be best if I could make a game that
	  was almost like a visual novel. I learned how to use fungus and it was extremley 
	  fun to use. I didn't think I'd like it so much, but I definatley think I'd use it 
	  again in the future. I made it so that the items in my room are talking to the 
	  player and explaining their history and connection to me. I wanted the room atmo
	  sphere to be almost calm and nostalgic so I added a serene and playful piece of music 
	  at the end.
