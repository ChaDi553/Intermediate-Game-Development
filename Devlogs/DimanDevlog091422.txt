	Being a programmer sounds like the worst roles for me because of the complexity of 
 game engines and how even a small issue within a game could become so time consuming 
 to incorporate. As an artist even though many things aren't straightforward I atleast
 know how I am going to get to my final goal. With programming (especially for games), 
 Almost everything is an unknown. I programmed a lot in HS and I really could never gr
 asp it even though I tried really hard. I definitely don't think i want to work in
 the games industry because I feel like there wouldn't be so much creative freedom for
 me as a digital since I'd be working for a studio. I was interested in games in HS 
 because I liked the merge between art and tech especially with indie games. I'd really 
 like to be a graphic designer, concept artist, fashion designer, tattoo artist etc. I'd
 like to try many things. When reading the door problem I realized that when the player 
 said "I didn't even notice the door was there" it just represented how underappreciated 
 peoples roles in the game industry is and how much work actually goes into it.
